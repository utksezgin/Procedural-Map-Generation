# Procedural-Map-Generation
Fall 2020 Graduation project for generating procedural maps on Unreal Engine 4


Project demo link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pw7GQH0C_wBumIJ6tGHPRRyqUktqXadP?usp=sharing

The  demo has 3 tiers of monsters with 2 different monsters in each tier, 3 tiers of rewards with 2 rewards in each tear and 3 different events.

Note that these all are placeholders and have no logic behind them as of yet. They are there for testing the generation.
